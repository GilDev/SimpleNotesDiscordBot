SimpleNotes Discord Bot
=======================

A bot that allows anyone on a server to write simple text notes for anyone to read.  
This was inspired by Telegram bots that I often see on some channels of which I’m a member.


## Requirements

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org) (tested on 3.7.7)
* [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) (tested on 1.3.3)


## Usage

* Create a `discord_token.txt` file at the project’s root containing the bot’s token
* Execute [`main.py`](main.py): `python3 main.py`

## TODO

* Logs should be shown through the `logging` package.
